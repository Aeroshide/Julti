v0.15.1:
- Added a delay to world pause when pie chart is enabled
- Added some more dirt cover checks to make it more stable

v0.15.0:
- **Removed fullscreen mode** due to it being too slow and jank. Fullscreen can still be used during runs by using Julti's fullscreen hotkey. Refer to v0.14.0 patch notes.
- Added support for instances that do not use the World Preview mod (will perhaps allow for stuff like pre-1.9 in the future) (#43)
- Added Pie Chart On Load option, which is illegal for normal runs and is meant for superflat runs (apparently) (#42)
- "Launch All Instances" button will now only try to launch instances that are not open.
- Lots of code cleanup regarding resetting, some stuff slightly adjusted to match intended functionality
- Fixed instances failing to reset sometimes (#41)
- Fixed a bug where windows would lose their borderless-ness when resetting from a fullscreened window sometimes

- Added fullscreen hotkey
    - Should not be the same as the actual fullscreen hotkey

- Removed brine
